=== DOCUMENT OVERVIEW ===
{overview}

=== YOUR TASK ===
Generate {count} queries to deeply extract the document's content. Your queries should cover:

1. **What the document is about**: Main ideas, core concepts, problems addressed, key arguments
2. **Specific content and details**: Methods, techniques, algorithms, formulas, data, results, examples
3. **Domain-specific information**: Technical details, parameters, implementations relevant to this document's field
4. **Different sections/aspects**: Ensure queries cover diverse parts of the document

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each query must be directly answerable from the document
- Ask about concrete specifics (numbers, methods, results, examples)
- Don't repeat information already in the overview
- Cover both conceptual understanding and technical details

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
